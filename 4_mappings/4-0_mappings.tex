\chapter{Mappings as the Key for Knowledge Graph Construction}
\label{chapter:mappings}

Mappings are the key element for the Knowledge Graph construction process to enhance maintainability, understandability and reproducibility. This chapter first formally defines mappings, to establish the basis for the rest of the document. Then, then an extensive analysis of current mapping languages is presented in the form of a comparison framework. Based on this comparison, a set of requirements are extracted and used for building an ontology that aims at gathering the expressiveness of current mapping languages. Finally, the evolution of a well-known mapping language is presented for adopting RDF-star.
