\chapter{Enhancing the Creation of Mapping Rules}
\label{chapter:creation}

The mappings used for constructing knowledge graphs can be created in different ways. As they are formatted as text documents, they can be directly written in any text editor. However, the verbosity of some languages and the need of following a specific syntax has foster the development of user-friendly tools and serialisations to ease the mapping writing process. This chapter introduces two solutions for easing the construction of mappings for different potential users, (i) a spreadsheet-based approach to write the mapping rules, and (ii) a serialisation updated with the latest needs in KG construction.
