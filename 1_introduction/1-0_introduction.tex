\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter:intro}


* General context about knowledge graphs, they are everywhere, representing every kind of information, used for many different purposes. 

* General context about how to create KGs: code libraries, tools like openrefine, and mappings. Then on and on with mappings, how they have evolved blabla, increasing support by different engines blabla

* Mappping-compliant technologies are increasingly proving to be convenient/useful/good for KGs: maintainability, understandability, engines already optimized, no need to code (accessibility for wider range of profiles). 

However, data is still complex, the requirements for KG evolve and these languages are sometimes limited. **Then first reference to a whole: gather which are these necessities**

Then about how to write mappings, still hard for many people who find it difficult or blabla, how to increase the adoption by making the user experience better: visual approaches do not scale and blabla. user friendly serializations are popular, we keep on updating them with needs already identified (above), and develop a new approach that can be for bot domain experts and experienced practitioners.

\ana{Por aquí hay que leer y meter cosas de KG life cycle } teniendo en cuenta que los mappings están en construcción, se podría plantear cómo pueden ayudar en el mantenimiento y evolución de KGs, son suficientemente robustos los current approaches para este purpose?

\section{Thesis structure}

The remainder of this thesis is structured as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \cref{chapter:sota} reviews the current state of the art of the topics related to this thesis. \ana{moar cuando sepa la estructura de la sección}
    
    \item \cref{chapter:objectives} presents the main objectives and contributions of this thesis, along with the assumptions, hypotheses and restrictions of the work. 
    
    \item In \cref{chapter:mappings} we define a comparison framework to analyze the features of current mapping languages. This framework helps extract a set of requirements for knowledge graph construction, that are gathered and represented in an ontology. Additionally, we present a particular case of the update of the RML mapping language to address some of the presented requirements, specifically the RML-star module to construct RDF-star graphs.
    
    \item In \cref{chapter:creation} we present two approaches to facilitate the creation of mapping documents for users. The first relies on spreadsheets to write mapping rules, and is with real users with different backgrounds to test is usability. The second supposes an update on the YARRRML user friendly syntax with recent modifications over RML. Both these approaches are presented with compliant tools to create mapping documents in target languages. 
    
    \item In \cref{chapter:evolution} we assess the role that mapping-compliant technologies can play in knowledge graph evolution. We conduct and empirical evaluation performing schema changes with KG construction engines that use mappings, and SPARQL \texttt{CONSTRUCT} queries, and evaluate which approach is more suitable in different situations. 
    
    \item Finally, \cref{chapter:conclusions} draws the main conclusions of the presented work, and outlines the future lines of research. 
    
    \item Appendix?
