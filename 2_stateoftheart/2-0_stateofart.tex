\chapter{State of the Art}
\label{chapter:sota}

In this chapter, we discuss the state of the art in declarative construction of knowledge graphs. We first present the representation of knowledge graphs on the web (\cref{sec:chp2_semweb}). Then we focus on describing current techniques to build knowledge graphs, focusing on the declarative approaches that use mapping rules (\cref{sec:chp2_declarative_kgc}), and the user-friendly approaches developed to facilitate this task (\cref{sec:chp2_easy_kgc}). We also describe the current proposals and methodologies for supporting the knowledge graph life cycle (\cref{sec:chp2_kg_lifecycle}).
