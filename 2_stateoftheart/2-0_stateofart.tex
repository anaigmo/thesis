\chapter{State of the Art \textcolor{red}{-- By 2/2}}
\label{chapter:sota}

In this chapter, we discuss the state of the art in declarative construction of knowledge graphs. We first present \textcolor{red}{the representation of knowledge on the web} (\cref{sec:chp2_semweb}). Then we focus on describing current techniques to construct knowledge graphs, focusing on the declarative approaches (\cref{sec:chp2_declarative_kgc}), and the user-friendly approaches developed to facilitate this task (\cref{sec:chp2_easy_kgc}). We also describe the current proposals and methodologies for supporting the knowledge graph life cycle \ana{queda algo suelto, encajar algo de construcción y porqué tiene esto relevancia con el resto} (\cref{sec:chp2_kg_lifecycle}).

\section{Conclusions and limitations of the State of the Art \textcolor{red}{-- By 2/2}}

\ana{hay que reformular, pero estas serian las ideas} 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{identification and characterization of expressivenes and features of current mapping languages to identify needs and challenges in KGC with declarative approaches}
    \item \textit{for mapping creation: visual approaches not really adopted, but serializations not really suitable for non-technical profies, find the middle ground there}
    \item \textit{to motivate the adoption of declarative KGC technologies, see in which parts or how can be involved in other parts of KG life cycle and if it really can improve the process}
\end{itemize}
